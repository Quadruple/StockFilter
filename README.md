<h3>Stock Filter</h3>
<h5>I recently got into stock exchange and learned about technical and 
fundamental analysis. Upon learning and applying the techniques to the real
market, I saw that going through the stocks one by one and applying the 
techniques is time consuming but can be automated. Stock Filter is a software
for applying multiple technical and fundamental analysis methods onto a set of
stocks and filter out the ones giving out buy signals automatically.</h5>

<h3>Main Goal</h3>
<h5>The main goal of the software is to evolve this into a fully functional 
trading bot.</h5>

<h3>Technicals</h3>
<h5>I was chasing for an opportunity for practising functional programming, 
so Stock Filter is written with functional programming principals. Due to 
math heavy indicators and analysis methods, I have chosen Python.</h5>

<h3>Current Objectives</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increasing technical indicators (Currently only MACD is implemented)</li>
<li>Introducing fundamental analysis techniques</li>
<li>Converting the functions of indicators into more parameterized versions</li>
<li>Parameterizing the indices so other indices can be analyzed as well. (Currently XU100 only)</li>
<li>Introducing parallelism to the whole filtering process to reduce time consumption</li>
</ul>
